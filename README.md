An introductory calculus lab about rates of change.

This lab is meant to be completed using [Microsoft Excel](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/excel). Free alternatives like [Google Sheets](https://www.google.com/sheets/about/) and [LibreOffice Calc](https://www.libreoffice.org/discover/calc/) are also available. A dedicated introductory Excel lab can be found [here](https://github.com/adam-rumpf/excel-intro-lab).

## Description

This is a computer lab meant for use near the beginning of a Calculus I course. The lab introduces the idea of a continuous function represented as a discrete time series, and of using that time series to approximate the instantaneous rate of change of the function using difference quotients.
